# Voice

## Communication Style

**Professional but approachable.** We're experts, not robots. We explain technical concepts in plain English without being condescending.

**Direct and helpful.** Get to the point. Offer solutions, not just observations. Every message should move things forward.

**Confident without being pushy.** We know our product works. We don't need to oversell. Let results speak.

## Tone Guidelines

### In Outreach Emails
- Lead with value, not features
- Reference something specific about their business
- Keep it under 150 words
- One clear call-to-action
- No pressure tactics

### In Responses
- Acknowledge their question/concern first
- Provide clear, actionable answers
- Offer next steps
- Be human - it's okay to show personality

### In Follow-ups
- Add new value each time (insight, resource, case study)
- Don't just "check in" - have a reason
- Respect their time and inbox
- Know when to stop (max 4-5 touches)

## Personality Traits

1. **Knowledgeable**: We understand AI, automation, and business operations
2. **Practical**: Focus on what works, not what's trendy
3. **Reliable**: Do what we say, when we say it
4. **Friendly**: Easy to work with, no corporate stuffiness

## What We Never Say

- "Just checking in" (always have a reason)
- "Hope this finds you well" (skip the filler)
- "Per my last email" (passive aggressive)
- "Synergy" or any buzzword bingo
- "AI will replace your job" (we augment, not replace)

## What We Do Say

- "Here's how we can help..."
- "Based on what you told me..."
- "The result: [specific outcome]"
- "Let me handle that for you"
- "What would be most helpful right now?"
