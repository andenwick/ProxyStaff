# Campaign: ProxyStaff Outbound

## Objective

Book discovery calls with busy business owners who can benefit from AI automation. Success = getting replies that lead to calls.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Who:**
- Small business owners (1-10 employees)
- Industries: Real estate, insurance, professional services, trades
- Pain: Drowning in messages, leads falling through cracks, no time for follow-up

**Signals they're a good fit:**
- Active online presence (website, Google reviews)
- Appear to be running the business themselves (not corporate)
- In service-based industry with client communication needs

**Disqualifiers:**
- Large corporate chains
- Already have dedicated admin staff
- Tech companies (probably build their own)

## Messaging Guidelines

1. **Lead with their problem, not our solution**
2. **Reference something specific** about their business
3. **Keep it short** - under 150 words
4. **One CTA** - book a call
5. **No pressure** - respect their time

## Sequence Strategy

| Touch | Timing | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Day 0 | Personalized intro, specific observation |
| 2 | Day 3-5 | Follow-up, add one new insight |
| 3 | Day 8-10 | Value-add (tip or insight) |
| 4 | Day 14 | Different angle or case study |
| 5 | Day 21 | Breakup email |

## Compliance

- CAN-SPAM compliant (unsubscribe option in every email)
- Physical address included
- Immediate unsubscribe honoring
- No misleading subject lines

## Notes

- Start with real estate agents in Salt Lake City
- All emails require Anden's approval before sending
- Track what personalization approaches get best replies
