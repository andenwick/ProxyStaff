# Frequently Asked Questions

## Product Questions

### "Is this just a chatbot?"
No. Chatbots follow rigid scripts and break easily. ProxyStaff is a full AI assistant powered by Claude (Anthropic's AI). It understands context, remembers your business, and handles nuanced conversations. Think of it as a trained team member, not a phone tree.

### "How is this different from ChatGPT?"
ChatGPT is a general tool you have to prompt yourself. ProxyStaff is:
- **Pre-configured** for your specific business
- **Integrated** with your tools (email, calendar, CRM)
- **Autonomous** - it acts on your behalf, not just answers questions
- **Persistent** - it remembers everything across conversations
- **Managed** - we handle the technical stuff

### "Will it sound robotic or generic?"
No. We configure the AI with your voice, tone, and personality. We capture how YOU communicate during the discovery call. Responses feel like they came from you or a well-trained assistant.

### "What can it actually do?"
- Respond to messages and emails
- Qualify leads with smart questions
- Schedule appointments
- Send follow-ups automatically
- Run outbound campaigns (with your approval)
- Remember every detail about your clients
- Execute custom workflows

## Process Questions

### "How long does setup take?"
Typically 1-2 weeks from discovery call to live:
- Day 1: Discovery call (30 min)
- Days 2-5: Configuration and integration
- Days 6-10: Testing and refinement
- Day 10+: Live with support

### "What do I need to provide?"
- 30 minutes for the discovery call
- Access to accounts we'll integrate (email, calendar)
- Feedback during testing phase
- That's it. We handle everything else.

### "Do I need technical skills?"
Zero technical skills required. You interact with your AI through normal messaging (Telegram, email). We handle all the technical setup and maintenance.

## Concern Questions

### "What if it makes a mistake?"
Three safeguards:
1. **Approval mode**: High-stakes actions (like outbound emails) require your approval
2. **Learning**: Mistakes become training - the AI learns from corrections
3. **Escalation**: It knows when to hand off to you for complex situations

### "What if I don't like it?"
We'll work with you to fix any issues. If it's truly not a fit, we'll part ways professionally. No long-term contracts forcing you to stay.

### "Will it replace my staff?"
No. It handles routine tasks so your team can focus on high-value work. Think of it as giving everyone a capable assistant, not replacing anyone.

## Security Questions

### "Is my data secure?"
Yes:
- Your data stays in your environment
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- No sharing with third parties
- You control access and can delete anytime

### "Who can see my conversations?"
Only you. We don't access your data unless you explicitly ask for support help. All credentials are encrypted and stored securely.

## Sales Questions

### "Can I try before committing?"
The discovery call is free with no obligation. We'll give you an honest assessment of whether ProxyStaff is right for your business. If we're not a good fit, we'll tell you.

### "What's the catch?"
No catch. We succeed when you succeed. Our business model is simple: help businesses automate, charge a fair price, deliver results.

### "Why should I trust you?"
- We use ProxyStaff ourselves (this outreach is powered by it)
- We're a small team that depends on reputation
- We'll give you references from current users
- No long-term lock-in - you can leave anytime

## Objection Responses

### "I'm too busy to set this up"
That's exactly why you need this. The discovery call is 30 minutes. After that, we handle everything. You're too busy NOT to automate.

### "I tried AI before and it didn't work"
Most AI tools are generic and require you to do the work. We configure everything specifically for your business. It's not the same thing.

### "It's too expensive"
Consider the cost of NOT automating:
- Hours spent on repetitive tasks
- Leads lost to slow follow-up
- Burnout from being always-on
The ROI usually pays for itself in weeks.

### "I'll think about it"
Totally fair. What specific questions can I answer to help you decide? Or, what would you need to see to feel confident?
