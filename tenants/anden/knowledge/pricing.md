# Pricing

## Pricing Model

**Custom quotes based on discovery call.**

Every business is different. We price based on:
- Complexity of workflows to automate
- Number of integrations needed
- Volume of messages/tasks
- Level of customization required

## Typical Structure

### Setup Fee (One-Time)
Covers discovery, configuration, and deployment:
- Discovery call and business analysis
- AI personality and workflow configuration
- Integration setup
- Testing and refinement
- Training and handoff

### Monthly Retainer
Covers ongoing operation and improvement:
- AI hosting and operation
- Continuous learning and optimization
- Support and adjustments
- New feature additions

## What Affects Pricing

**Lower cost:**
- Standard workflows (messaging, scheduling, follow-ups)
- Common integrations (Gmail, Google Calendar)
- Lower message volume

**Higher cost:**
- Custom tool development
- Complex multi-step workflows
- High volume operations
- Multiple channels/platforms

## ROI Consideration

Consider the value of your time:
- If you bill $200/hour and save 10 hours/week = $8,000/month in time value
- If you convert 2 more leads/month from better follow-up = significant revenue
- If you reduce hiring needs = tens of thousands in salary + benefits

## Next Step
